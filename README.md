Introducing the I-3030 V4 - a new iteration of a 3D printer that is # designed to meet the needs and wants of both, hobbyists and # professionals alike.

This 200x300x200mm machine is packed with features that set it apart from the competition and ensure an exceptional printing experience.
Equipped with a 32-bit Duet controller that has WiFi connectivity and a WEB-based user interface, it is easy to use and allows for remote operation of the printer.

The quiet TMC2660 steppers and advanced RRF3 software enable sensorless self-calibration through automation macros, making it possible to achieve high-quality prints every time with minimal user intervention.

The I-3030 V4 boasts a new printing core that combines a high flow Phaetus Dragon hot-end, a Piezoelectric Orion Z-probe, and a state-of-the-art LGX extruder from Bondtech. This extremely powerful combination ensures consistent and high-quality prints that are unmatched by other printers in the market.

In addition, the I-3030 V4 has an extremely rigid Aluminum extrusion frame that makes it easy to build and use in tough environments, which makes it a top choice for those who need a printer that can withstand challenging conditions, such as in some occupied nations at the moment. 
The machine is built with 12-volt components, which means that it is easily convertible to be used in vehicles or in the field away from the power grid.
